    "\n",
    "The challenge here will be to analyze the text of the included job descriptions, but to also compare the words and phrases there with a reference set. In this case, we will use Reuters news articles as a background corpus to compare our possible jargon text with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will require that you read in the text of the job descriptions and then tokenize them. You will then need to take the tokens and compare them to the Reuters as both individual tokens and also as bigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need not look at the frequency of the terms. We are aiming for just term differences, so simply reporting back the tokens that are only in the job descriptions will be sufficient. One key thing to consider here is what kind of tokens will you want to report on. For example, the job descriptions might contain numbers and other things. Generally, you'd not want to report back numbers. Also, you might want to consider lowercasing things. \n",
